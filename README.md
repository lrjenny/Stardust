Stardust is a simple game demonstrating emergence as a result of interactions of systems.

In Stardust, there is one spaceship attempting to survive a constant barrage of alien dive-bomb attacks. The spaceship will dodge incoming aliens and shoot at them with it's laser gun. The aliens will pursue the spaceship and attempt to dodge incoming laser fire.
